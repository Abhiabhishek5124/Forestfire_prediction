# Forest Fire Prediction Project

Welcome to the Forest Fire Prediction project! This project was created during my high school days as part of learning machine learning algorithms with my friends. It focuses on predicting forest fire occurrences using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a forest fire prediction system utilizing Django and machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest Regression. The system takes input parameters related to a specific location and predicts the likelihood and intensity of a forest fire. The prediction is based on historical data and environmental factors.

## Project Setup

1. **Project Directory:** Create a dedicated directory to manage your project files.

2. **Virtual Environment:** Set up a virtual environment within the project directory to manage dependencies.

3. **Directory Structure:** Organize your project by placing the 'mysite' directory inside the main project directory.

4. **Dependency Installation:** Install project dependencies using the command:  pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Database Migration:** Navigate to the 'mysite' directory and run: python manage.py migrate

This establishes the database schema required for the project.

6. **Server Launch:** Start the development server with: python manage.py runserver

## Contributing

This project was a collaborative effort during high school. Contributions and improvements are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or provide feedback.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to acknowledge my friends who collaborated on this project during our high school days. Our shared passion for machine learning and environmental awareness led to the creation of this forest fire prediction system.
